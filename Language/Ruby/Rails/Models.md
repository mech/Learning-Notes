---

1. Service Object
2. Form Object
3. Value object
4. Query Object
5. View Object
6. Policy Object - Whitelist? Gate? Access Control?
7. Decorator

```ruby
class Unit < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :tracking_barcode, presence: true
  
  with_options on: :shipment_to_vendor do
    validates :product_id, presence: true
    validates :vendor_id, presence: true
  end
end

# custom validation contexts
@unit.save!(context: :shipment_to_vendor)

# Service object
UnitShippedToVendor.new(@unit).save!
```

```ruby
# Using Dry Validation
class MyFormObject
  self.schema = Dry::Validation.Form do
    optional(:attributes).maybe(:hash?)
    optional(:remember_me).maybe(:bool?)
    optional(:email).maybe(:str?)
    optional(:note).maybe(:str?)
  end
end
```

## Repository

Think about it. Let's say you are changing something in the `OrderLine` class. How would you grep your codebase to find all possible places querying it directly? Relying on some columns or data being there? You need to look for `OrderLine`, `order_line`, `order_lines` and combination of it with `find`, `where`, etc. and you still might not find all places.

It would be a bit easier if we use the **repository pattern** and at least we know all possible queries that are executed on our tables.

## Service Object

See Interactor, Command Pattern, Operation, etc.

Not all about `app/services` folder in Rails.

* [Easier to see mistakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgKlu5gFsJM)
* Easier to navigate work site

```ruby
# Prefer explicit stateless to fluent interface
module PolicyService
  def self.purchase_policy(user, params)
    # purchase a policy using user
  end
end
```

The ideal way to build large Rails backends is by implementing the majority of the domain logic as static stateless methods. Procedural programming is actually good. Use Transaction Script rather than ActiveRecord pattern. If using OOP, you need to hold many states in your head at once.

* [Does my Rails app need a service layer?](https://blog.carbonfive.com/2012/01/10/does-my-rails-app-need-a-service-layer/)
* [Essential RubyOnRails patterns — part 1: Service Objects](https://medium.com/selleo/essential-rubyonrails-patterns-part-1-service-objects-1af9f9573ca1)

A service is an ACTION, not a thing. Instead of forcing the operation into an existing object, we should encapsulate it in a separate, stateless service.

> Service layers are all about verbs.

3 types of services:

1. Application - CSV reporting?
2. Domain - Services that involve multiple domain objects where responsibilities is spread
3. Infrastructure - Involve external system like sending email and message queues. Mostly non-domain, "software" concerns.

---

* Specific to a use-case.
* Can also be seen as a Command Object, to use a design pattern name for it.
* Define application boundary that establishes a set of available operations.
* Encapsulate cross-cutting operations. Involves several models.
* Encapsulate a single process of the business logic. Describe one business rule only.
* Is functional, don't store any states. Services get input and produce output.
* Application services orchestrate flow & usage of **aggregates** by loading and saving them to/from repositories.

In Rails, controller is the boundary we want to separate. Service Object is the bridge between controller boundary and domain object. Controller's `params` acts as input and Service Object's output determine result (`render` or `redirect`).

```ruby
def create
  form = TimesheetService::Form.new(params)
  
  # Form object can quickly bailout if it is not even valid
  if form.valid?
    result = TimesheetService::Save.new(form)
    # result = TimesheetService.save(self)
    
    # Result is the next deeper level of bailout when
    # contract with third-party service
    result.success? ? render_ok(result) : render_error(result)
  else
    render_error(form)
  end
rescue ServiceError => e
  Audit::Exceptional.error(e)
end
```

Most Services use the `call()` so you can use a closure as well. Some services also use `execute()`.

Some services use verbs instead of nouns: `Movies::Create` vs `Movies::Creator`.

```ruby
# Your service object do not need to have only run() or execute()
# or call() methods. It can be descriptive also.
class OrdersService
  def expire(order_number)
    Order.transaction do
      order = Order.lock.find(order_number) # Load
      order.expire                          # Operate
      order.save!                           # Save
    end
  end
end
```

* [How to keep your controllers thin with Form Objects](https://ducktypelabs.com/how-to-keep-your-controllers-thin-with-form-objects/)

Encapsulate logic related to validating and persisting data.

You can move validation to Form Object, but your model still need it just in case.

> So this isn't a SRP violation, they are two different responsibilities and relate to different chapters in the lifecycle of information.

```ruby
# At the controller
@company_form = CompanyForm.new(company_params)

# The form object
class CompanyForm
  include ActiveModel::Model

  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :number, presence: true
  validate :validate_company_and_phone
  
  # Act as the parent object
  def self.model_name
    Company.model_name
  end
  
  def save
    return unless valid?
    ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
      company.save!
      phone.save!
    end
  end
  
  private
  
  def company
    @company ||= Company.new(name: name)
  end
  
  def phone
    @phone ||= @company.phones.build(number: number, primary: true)
  end
  
  def validate_company_and_phone
    return display_errors(company.errors) if company.invalid?
    return display_errors(phone.errors) if phone.invalid?
  end
  
  # Bubble error from child relationship up to the parent
  def display_errors(errors)
    errors.each do |attribute, message|
      errors.add(attribute, message)
    end
  end
end
```

## Entity

Entities are **BE** things. They are the being, not the doing. Even though they have operations on them, their operations are only about their data.

Entities are **DATA**.

Everything else is a **doer**, and they do one thing.

## Value Object (Immutable)

Examples: `ActiveSupport::TimeZone`, `GrossAmount`, `VatRate`

> Value objects often represent compound attributes grouped together into one class like `Money` class.

* [tcrayford/Values](https://github.com/tcrayford/Values)
* [To Clojure and back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doZ0XAc9Wtc)
* [Value Objects Like a Pro](https://hackernoon.com/value-objects-like-a-pro-f1bfc1548c72)

Simple, small object that represents certain value-ness instead of an identity. Examples are money values in various currencies, temperatures, etc.

Conversion and comparison of values is one of the function Value object can perform reliably.

Anytime you need to do immutable conversion or comparison, you can consider encapsulate those logics into Value object.

```ruby
class Temperature
  include Comparable
  SCALES = %w(:kelvin :celsius)
  
  attr_reader :degrees, :scale, :kelvin_degrees
  
  def initialize(degrees, scale = :kelvin)
    @degrees = degrees.to_f
    @scale = case scale
    when *SCALES then scale
    else :kelvin
    end
    
    @kelvin_degrees = case @scale
    when :kelvin
      @degrees
    when :celsius
      @degrees + 273.15
    end
  end
  
  def self.from_celsius(degrees)
    new(degrees, :celsius)
  end
  
  def self.from_kelvin(degrees)
    new(degrees, :kelvin)
  end
  
  def <=>(other)
    kelvin_degrees <=> other.kelvin_degrees
  end
end
```

## Query Object

As much as possible use ActiveRecord scopes or class methods to generate query. Do not do the query inside controller.

> I find that scopes are best used when they're simple and don't do too much. I think of them as reusable building blocks. If I need to do something more complicated, I used a Query class to encapsulate the potentially gnarly query.

```ruby
class VolunteersNotMemberQuery
  def initialize(year:)
    @year = year
  end
  
  def relation
    volunteer_ids = GroupMembership.select(:person_id).school_year(@year)
    pta_member_ids = PtaMembership.select(:person_id).school_year(@year)
    
    Person
      .active
      .adults
      .where(id: volunteer_ids) # Will become sub-query
      .where.not(id: pta_member_ids)
      .order(:last_name)
  end
end
```

## View Object

* [Draper](https://github.com/drapergem/draper)

A.k.a Serializer or Presenter

Good when you want to represent JSON response or HTML view. This is especially helpful when you have controller and model information like `articles_path` URL to show to the user.

## Policy Object

If you want to enforce policy like who has permission to create resources, how many resources can be created, who can view what, you need Policy Object. Policy Objects are interchangeable. They can be replaced depending on access level or other context.

Move the policy checking out of the controller and model.

```ruby
class CreateInvoicePolicy
  def initialize(user)
    @user = user
  end
  
  def allowed?
    @user.finance? && !blocked
  end
  
  private
  
  def blocked
  end
end

class InvoiceController < ApplicationController
  def create
    if policy.allowed?
      InvoiceService.new(invoice_params)
    else
      head :unauthorized
    end
  end
  
  private
  
  def policy
    CreateInvoicePolicy.new(current_user)
  end
end
```

## Decorator

* [Strategy vs Decorator](https://www.google.com.sg/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=decorator%20vs%20strategy)

* If you have many actions to cover
* When you want to add more auxiliary behavior to individual object without affecting other objects of the same class
* Format complex data for display
