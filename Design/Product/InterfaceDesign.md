> Let the idea evolve

> What UI must do? - Give a lot of context on what things is happening. See progress. Qualitative measurement. See [Basecamp Hill Chart...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwrI6rxELFw&t=15s)

> The choice and execution of the patterns and their unique combination are influenced by a product’s purpose, ethos and design principles.

---

> Web interface is not the same as desktop interface!

---

> Many commercial software applications include user interfaces in which a screen presents a set of controls, but leaves it to the user to deduce the page's purpose and how to use the controls to accomplish that purpose. 

---

> Instead of defining the face of our content — the stuff that appears in the UI — we should start by defining the how and the why that support that content - [Building Block Design](https://medium.com/ruxers/building-block-design-a-modular-design-strategy-for-uxers-927f63eec90c)

> The ways in which we experience and consume information are growing and changing - and the information available to us is often richer and more complex.

* Adding the word "Please" slow people down in a dialog box. Remove it!
* Good user interface design is based on human goals and behavior. The user interface in-turn effects behavior, which further design decisions are based on. In subtle and unconscious ways, user experience alters how humans make decisions. What is seen, where it is presented, and how interactions are afforded, influence actions.
* Clarity
* [Ruthless prioritization](https://medium.com/@dburka/i-really-appreciate-the-response-5f765a270a8b)
* Remove all extra elements - every item should have a purpose
* Simplify color scheme - limit the number of used colors
* Chronological order - feeds, events, etc.
* We learned that users often lose their place in the system. The implication is that the UI should prioritize clarifying context.
* Be great at "look" and "do"
* The more we wanted to communicate earlier in the journey, the more users got confused. The crisper and concise we kept our communication and quickly brought the users to try our app, the more we got them comfortable.
* Progressively unfold content to increase awareness of how things actually worked
* Show just enough information to support essential decisions - no more, no less.
* If something is related to something else, they should be near each other. This sounds obvious at first, but lack of grouping is a surprisingly common mistake.
* More options means people slow down
* A well-designed and humane interface does not need to be split into beginner and expert subsystems - Jef Raskin
* Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious and adding the meaningful – John Maeda
* Innovation is often the product of constraint – Todd Waterbury
* Don't let problem hide, show feedback!
* 5S - (Sort - remove unnecessary thing), (Straighten - make things easy to find), (Shine - keep workspace clean and safe), (Standardize - keep everything in its place), (Sustain - perform 5S as a routine)
* Clients want THE SOLUTION, not THE SERVICE.
* We needn't all pray at the beautiful minimalist design altar. Design doesn't have to be precious. Toss out your assumptions and build what works best.
* Sometimes the system finds many problems, other times only a few. The UI had to handle both extremes gracefully.

> UI design is just a series of "endless tweaking". Always changing the UI. Adaptability. Unexpected demand of the business.

## Mental Models

* [](https://medium.com/swlh/leveraging-mental-models-in-ux-design-21ba8fbce22d)

## Interaction Modes

* [Have good manners](https://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-interaction-modes)

## Patterns

* Patterns are especially important when redesigning an existing interface. They help find flaws in interactions and help you to understand what works best for your users.

## Filter

* [Users Don't Want Filters, They Want Better Content](https://medium.com/@hopper_travel/users-dont-want-filters-they-want-better-content-3146f650b8f6)

## Architecture

* Firmitas (Durability) - A building should stand up robustly and remain in good condition. UI should function robustly and correctly and not say one thing and do it another way. Free of crashes.
* Vtilitas (Utility) - Suitable for the purposes for which it is used. Material being used is different from conference room and houses for living. UI should accommodate and know what it's eventual purpose is. Do not use table list for everything. Different content need different UI layout.
* Venvstas (Beauty) - it should be aesthetically pleasing. UI must be desirable.

## Value Proposition

When designing UI, ask what is the value proposition of that screen.

## Breadth and Depth

Start with breadth, then dive into depth.

Being with "horizontal prototype" that covers all your main screens. Your next iteration will dive deeper into user flows for each screen.

## Storyboarding UI

* Writing - Writing the text. Write out a basic script. Make sure the heart of the content is solid.
* Thumb-nailing - Storyboarding out the sequence.
* [Every interface is a story](https://uxdesign.cc/every-interface-is-a-story-2e48d5285c39)

> Storytelling and writing have never been so present in the design world. As customer journeys become more fragmented, it is our job to ensure brands are telling a coherent story across channels — and that those stories are clear, interesting, and human.

## The Purpose of UI Design

* [Interface](https://spectrum.chat/thread/ac4cba39-0582-4b73-9582-9e863ed66346)

> A software company's purpose is to solve some problem for a user. An effective solution can be enabling new behaviors, making existing processes easier, reducing cost, or simply giving people something they enjoy.
> 
> This maps directly to the purpose of any interface designer's work - which is to **compose an interaction layer** for software that enables users to access solutions to a given problem set.

## Swiss Formalism

* Simple typeface
* Rational grid
* Bold visual aesthetic
* Dominating black headlines

## Stages of User Journey

* Mapping

## UI Names

* Excerpt (little pieces of information)
* Drawer/inspector/properties

## No Spinner

* Disable submit button with "in progress" label, disable form elements
* Show transitional overlay (e.g. "Connecting to PayPal...")
* Erase content area of the page
* No spinners!

## Blank Slate

## Complexion Reduction

* Remove color. You can have one color, use it sparingly to indicate action. Everything is back and white. **Let the content of your app bring the color**.
* Bigger, bolder, blacker headlines
* Simple, thin, recognizable icons
* Double your whitespace

## UI Density and Information Density

Depending on scale, the density of the UI can change.

Use arrows for places where there are information density.

## Application Shell

> You don't choose a layout. It chooses you. It's the result of the need to organize content, and it tends to take shape on its own.

An excellent way to get an impression of an application's power and purpose is to glance at the set of available functions by way of its menus and dialogs just like you do with a restaurant's menu.

Understanding the scope of what an application can and can't do is one of the fundamental aspects of creating an atmosphere conducive to learning to use a piece of software.

Different tasks require different configuration specific to it.

Accommodate change. Clear and crisp in its objectives and affordances.

Identify the parts of the environment that have different **rates of change** and make them the base structure.

How we use space to accomplish a task. (See [kitchen](http://andyfitzgerald.org/language-meaning-user-experience-architecture) example)

## Content Structure

* Designing **based upon intent** and **from the content out**.
* Don't adjust your content to template or application shell. Let them adjust to your content! See Bootstrap and all websites look the same.
* [Trouble in framework paradise](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-1/#trouble-in-framework-paradise)

> You can create good experiences without knowing the content. What you can't do is create good experiences without knowing your content structure. What is your content made from, not what your content is. - Mark Boulton

---

> Content needs to be structured and structuring alters your content, designing alters content. It's not 'content then design', or 'content or design'. It's 'content and design' - Mark Boulton

---

> The best approach to take is to let the content you have on your site dictate the actual widths you put into your media queries.

## Boxy Syndrome

* Break out of the box
* Breaking grid

## Variations

You need to articulate variations in templates, which is crucial for establishing robust and reliant design systems. For examples:

* A user has 1 item in their shopping cart and another has 10 items
* A dashboard typically show recent activity, but that section is suppressed for first-time users.
* An article headline might be 250 characters long.

To create more resilient design systems, you need to account for variations.

* Atoms - UI that can't be broken down any further and serve as the elemental building blocks
* Molecules - Collections of atoms that form relatively simple UI with Single Responsibility
* Organisms - Relatively complex components that form discrete sections of an interface
* Templates - Lo-fi grey boxes of **content structure**
* Pages - Apply real content to templates and articulate variations to demonstrate the final UI and test the resilience of the design system.

## Navigation

In a large, complex information environment, a complete lack of lateral and vertical navigation aids can be very limiting. On the other hand, too many navigation aids can bury the hierarchy and overwhelm the user.

Navigation can drown out the content.

* [Killing Off the Global Navigation: One Trend to Avoid](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/killing-global-navigation-one-trend-avoid/)

You can have 2 types of navigation structures: content-based structure and audience-based structure.

It shouldn't come as a surprise that when you change what your navigation looks like, you also are changing the way you communicate with your users. Typically a simple navigation will feature only one word per section label, so those words need to be chosen carefully.

### Information Scent

### Role-Based vs Topic-Based Navigation

Users don't necessarily self-identify, and they often don't understand which audience category contains the content that they want. Evaluate whether topic-based organization might be more efficient for your users.
