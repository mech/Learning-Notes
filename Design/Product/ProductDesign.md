> Failed assumption is necessary in our design explorations. We need more crappy work.

---

> Well, let's assume we are lazy by nature and that when we get presented with a challenging situation we are naturally going to refer to our own memories, to our previous experiences, to figure things out without trying too hard. It's fast, it's unconscious, and it's a trap. You're going to overlook the problem because your brain is a lazy little bastard. To get past that point, you need to force your brain and your creativity muscle to work.

> It's pretty simple: you have to keep on moving. While the first reaction would be to look at your blank canvas and only think of the potential moves you can do, the ideal way to actually get started is...getting started.

> Don't be afraid to throw things away. When we start planning a new, relatively large undertaking at Dribbble (or anywhere else I've been before) I always volunteer to sketch what the entire ecosystem of this new app/feature/whatever could look like. I let the team know I have no emotional attachment to this artifact and explain that it is simply a baseline for us to work from. By doing this, we can see the entire undertaking holistically and not in a vacuum. Then we can see how one change can have a ripple effect on everything else.

## Whole System

* Zoom out and in

## Software influence behavior

**Hospital case study**

Due to safety and validation concern, all patient form has to be validated before submission. This is a very noble approach, but it failed to take into account nurses are on time constraint and something lack detailed information of patient and must wait for data to come in after a while. The system prevent the nurses from doing their job efficiently just because of database validation.

**POS Cashier**

Developer get design spec from manager who have safety in mind and want to prevent cashier from doing any price adjustment. Any price adjustment require manager's approval.

This has performance issues because cashier will be slow to adjust price for a dozen products. So the new spec is modified to allow 10% allowance on price adjustment. This unfortunately lead to the behavior where all price are just adjusted forever at 10% because nobody want to go over the limit and bother the manager's approval.

## Strategy

* [Stratechery - Insight on Product Strategy](https://stratechery.com/)

Design strategy:

- Involve finding user's goals (User Research)
- Understanding mental model - Aligning design strategy with human behaviors
- Plan of action
- Strategy must be consistent
- Customer journey

Design tactic:

- Operation
- The art of doing
- Actual work
- Can change or evolve (no need to be too rigid)

Strategy govern tactical execution.

## Advice

* It's all about the experience.
* Having the Right Question can point development into the Right Direction. Like: "Is the cost of effort required to reduce those few gzipped bytes worth the benefits of saving a few dozen dollars in a year?"
* Even if it turns out to be a waste of time, at least you have wasted that time in the question before starting to build the answer.
* Set constraints. Whatever it is!
* Lean UX allows you to embrace continuous change to focus on outcome instead of feature. Sense and respond.
* Product need to improve in fast pace. Iterate on product and learn new thing and trigger scepticism.
* You MUST fail fast and fail early.
* Up-front user research is a form of Product Procrastination. It's busy-work. **Even though it was nice to "have the user in mind", the useful data came from the first user tests, not the research.**
* Make an ugly version where all the things work
* It needs to look like crap in order for it to move forward - the art of iteration
* Make a gorgeous version that doesn't do anything
* Store all of it
* Hold the designer accountable
* Reduce risk through compartmentalization
* To finish a project you must know what done looks like

* [Set expectations, do good-enough work and let the results worry about itself.](https://zellwk.com/blog/fighting-decision-paralysis/)
* If strategic design is missing from a product, no number of iterations can save it. Product managers need to establish the soul, the meaning, the why of a product early on, using thoughtful strategic design.
* Beneath every bad design concept is another more crazy, daring and wonderful. If you don't dig down into crazy ideas and give them a chance, you'll never find the wonderful ones buried beneath them.

## Microinteraction

* Focusing on tiny moment - Features vs Microinteraction
* Manual Triggers spring from explicit user wants or needs.
* Signature moment
* Bring the data forward - people has some interest in it. See Chrome's download count and progress circle.
* Don't start from zero. Get data from your existing customer. Watch my past behavior.
* Rules tell you what you can or cannot do.

## Design Sprint

* [Design Sprint Videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeB_OpLspKJGiKv1CYkWFFw/videos)
* Sprints can create habits in your company. After the first sprint, you might notice a shift in the way your team works. You'll look for ways to turn discussions into testable hypotheses.
* You'll look for ways to answer big questions, not someday, but this week.
* Taken the sprint process and used it on their own to solve problems, reduce risk, and make better decisions at work.
* Crazy 8 and silent voting: look at business problem and solve it with design without pushing individual feature preferences.

## Service Design

> Shifting from products to services requires not only a new mindset and methods, but also new organizational structures. Whereas in a product based organization, teams are organized around each product and organically piece together the customer experience of company offerings, in a services-based organization, teams are organized in alignment with the end-to-end customer experience of the service, with each 'product' as a touchpoint along that journey

## Goal-Directed Design

Developers tend to want to put up dialog boxes and error messages and all sorts of intrusive widgets that explain what's going on behind the scenes, but users don't care. They only want to know the thing is working so they can accomplish their GOALS.

A user's goal live outside the application. The goals are personal. Very few users have a goal of understanding how PeopleSoft works. The application itself is not a goal at all, it's an obstacle between user and his goal.

Goals and tasks are different. You only have one ultimate goal to a certain things. But you can have many tiny and potentially irrelevant or inefficient tasks that you are forced to perform en route to reaching that goal.

Using task-analysis allow us to fish out inefficient tasks or sub-optimal processes.

Find:

* Redundant task A
* Annoying task B
* I hate this part of my job task C

ACD can be very useful in breaking down the "**what**" of user behaviors, but it really doesn't address the first question any designer should ask: Why is a user performing an activity, task, action, or operation in the first place?

Goals motivate people to perform activities; understanding goals allows you to understand your users' expectations and aspirations, which in turn can help you decide which activities are truly relevant to your design. Task and activity analysis is useful at the detail level, but only after user goals have been analyzed.

Most Research provide information at the task level instead of true goal. This type of information is useful for defining layout, work flow, and translation of functions into interface controls. But it is less useful for defining the basic framework of what a product is, what it does, and how it should meet the user’s broad needs.

## Activity-Centered Design

People adapt to technology. It's possible to design things that support the needs of your users without knowing anything about their goals and dreams and ambitions.

Cars, alarm clocks, stove-tops, and millions of other devices have been developed almost entirely without the aid of Goal-Directed Design.

Donald Norman points out that many technologies and products have become great not as a result of deep understanding of users, but rather because of a "deep understanding of the activities that were to be performed".

> Focus upon individual people might improve things for them at a cost of making it worse for others. The more something is tailored for the particular likes, dislikes, skills, and needs of a particular target population, the less likely it will be appropriate for others.

Basecamp designed around an activity and enabled thousands of potentially very different user types to work within the parameters of the activity.

## Jobs To Be Done

It's not a feature, it's a problem. It's not a system, it's an experience.

> The problems people encounter in their lives rarely change from generation to generation. The products they hire to solve these problems change all the time.

---

> A key component of the JTBD framework is the replacement of user stories (Personas) with job stories. Job stories focus on the motivation and not the person. This helps to reduce bias contamination in the stories, but also increases the overall empathy within the story.

## Metaphors

Product design is all about metaphors. Every icon, every button, and every interaction is a metaphor for something in the physical world. The Dropbox icon is a metaphor for a storage box. Click-and-drag is a metaphor for picking things up with your hand.

But some metaphors mean different things in different cultures. In United States, an owl represents wisdom. In Finland and India, an owl can represent foolishness.
