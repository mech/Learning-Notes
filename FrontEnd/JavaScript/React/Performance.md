# React Performance

> Poor design choices often lead to issues and, in the case of React, if we do not put the state in the right place, the risk is that our components are going to render more than needed.

```
http://localhost:3000?react_perf
```

```js
componentWillUpdate() {
  Perf.start()
}

componentDidUpdate() {
  Perf.stop()
  
  // See which operations React has made on the DOM like
  // "insert child"
  Perf.printOperations()
}
```

`PureComponent` should be used only after the application has been monitored and the bottleneck has been found.

```js
class List extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ul>
        {this.state.items.map(item => (
          <Item key={item.id} item={item} />
        ))}
      </ul>
    )
  }
}

// Instead of rendering the <li> directly on the parent, we
// create additional component which is "pure" in order to
// take advantage of not rendering any unchanged item.
//
// If we were to just use <li>, it lack any shouldComponentUpdate
// capability and will always re-render.
class Item extends React.PureComponent {
  render() {
    return (
      <li>{this.props.item}</li>
    )
  }
}
```

Don't forget to avoid the common mistakes that make the `PureComponent` less effective, such as generating new functions inside the `render()`, or using constant as props.

## render()

* Do as little work as possible in the `render()` function
* Function binding and Object/Array literals are bad for performance
* Make checks cheap - Invalidate references whenever you change data.
* Make checks easy - Denormalize your data??

## shouldComponentUpdate

> We have a number of high level components that are responsible for fetching data. Whenever new data is fetched, it triggers a render of all of its children. Rendering all children due to a single piece of data updating can be costly and unnecessary when the fetched data doesn't modify the layout. Fortunately, with a couple of strategically placed `shouldComponentUpdate`s we were able to reduce the amount of time spent in scripting, layout, and painting considerably.

We can tell React to avoid reconciling **some parts of the tree**.

To find out the necessary steps to reduce the DOM operations, React has to fire the render methods of all the components and compare the results with the previous ones.

If nothing changes, no changes will be made in the DOM, which is great. But if our render methods do complex operations, React will take some time to figure out that no operations have to be done, which is not optimal.

We surely want our components to be simple and we should avoid doing expensive operations inside the renderer. However, sometimes we simply cannot manage this and our applications become slow, even if the DOM is not touched at all.

React is not able to figure out which components do not need to be updated but we have a function that we can implement to tell the library when to update a component or not.

## Stateless Functional Components

You can still use stateless components if you implement `shouldComponentUpdate()` on your container component correctly to prevent rendering of their children.

It is beneficial to implement `shouldComponentUpdate()` as high up the tree as possible.

## Event Handler and Re-rendering

* [Dealing with callbacks as props in React](https://dev.to/xnimorz/dealing-with-event-handlers-in-react-540j)

## PureComponent and React.memo

If there are no visible changes, although the actual DOM will not be altered, the render() method is still getting called and may waste time doing unnecessary virtual DOM building. We may as well skip it with PureComponent/memo

Typically you will want to use `PureComponent` for your leaf node in your render tree.

See this [Issue #8669](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8669)

## Binding

```js
// Instead of this, which will cause re-render everytime
<CommentItem likeComment={() => this.likeComment(user.id)} />

// Do this
<CommentItem likeComment={this.likeComment} userID={user.id} />

// And use
this.props.likeComment(this.props.userID)
```

## Constant Props

```js
// Will always re-render because props is array literal and
// re-create on every render
render() {
  <Item
    statuses={['open', 'close']}
  />
}

// Instead we should do it outside the render()
const statuses = ['open', 'close']
...
render() {
  <Item
    statuses={statuses}
  />
}
```

* [Optimizing React Performance with Stateless Components](https://www.sitepoint.com/optimizing-react-performance-stateless-components/)

Functional components can't use `shouldComponentUpdate`.

```js
import pure from 'recompose/pure'
import onlyUpdateForKeys from 'recompose/onlyUpdateForKeys'

const DatagridBody = ({ ids }) => (
  <tbody>
    {ids.map(id => (
      <tr></tr>
    ))}
  </tbody>
)

export default pure(DatagridBody)
```
