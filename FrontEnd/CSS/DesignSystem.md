> In order to better scope projects, it's essential to look at what the interface is comprised of rather than looking at the quantity/type of pages. This is what software developers have been doing for years now, but the concept of "Web pages" has distracted us from breaking things down into features and components - [Scope Component, not Pages](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/scope-components-not-pages/)

We are not designing static graphics. We are designing interactive systems. We are designing for intents and behaviours.

* The fundamental mistake of assuming a page is a uniform, isolated, quantifiable thing. The reality is that the web is a fluid, interactive, interdependent medium.
* Design System - The whole design language of the system. Voice and Tones, Typography, Brand Identity, Copy Writing, Color Palettes, Icons, Grid System, Code, UI Patterns, etc.

> Get control over your design with a system

Maintain a visual language, UI elements, components and page types to realize substantial efficiencies and consistency. The need for a cohesive design language is high.

> Visualizing all the discrete states an application can be in will make your design systems better. This in essence is the most pure form of a "living style guide" and will help your design team develop a cohesive and modular design system.

---

> Your design needs to adapt and change to fit the content on offer and the changing nature of the web. Whether it's a modified navigation bar to accommodate new sections, a new type of article page or a complete design refresh, the key to success is continuous improvement.

---

> A developer using a CSS library will not apply their own `padding: 16px` rule, but will apply grid classes to elements to conform to the specification.

---

> Our gaze remains transfixed on the final product, and we rarely if ever glance at the underlying patterns that comprise our final UIs.
> 
> Of course, there is another way to approach your LEGO and digital projects. Rather than diving headfirst into constructing the final work, you can take the time to take stock of the available pieces and organize them in such a way that they become more useful.
> 
> No doubt organizing takes time, planning, and effort. It doesn’t come for free. The fact that this configuring isn’t visibly represented in the final product may tempt us to say it serves as a distraction to the real work that needs to be done. Why bother?

> Really, the true task of the digital designer is not drawing screens; it's specifying the individual components that make up the screens. - [Digital product design is not graphic design](https://www.subformapp.com/articles/digital-not-graphic/)

---

> Designing the components in isolation often feels like a surefire recipe for a design that is generic, flat or lacking in a strong point of view. A strong design is informed by a view of the big picture, an understanding of the context, and strong art direction — even at the cost of consistency or time. - [Taking pattern libraries to the next level](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/taking-pattern-libraries-next-level/)

Unfortunately, creating a style guide is not always easy in web application because often the concerns are not well defined, and some elements get duplicated to achieve small variations in requirements.

> We should start with language, not interfaces - [Alla Kholmatova](https://alistapart.com/article/language-of-modular-design)
> A successful design system starts with CONTENT and PEOPLE

## Scenario-Driven, not Layout-Driven

## Screens, Reusable Components, States and Data

That's what our applications consist of.

## Why We Need Design System?

> When we reduce mental overhead, teams don't have to compromise on quality, even while they build and ship features fast.

* [Airbnb - Building a Visual Language](http://airbnb.design/building-a-visual-language/)

When you experience growth. When you have many more teams. When you have too few constraints.

Working in software development and design, we are often required to ship one-off solutions. Sometimes we're working within time constraints and sometimes we just haven't yet agreed upon a path forward. These one-off solutions aren't inherently bad, but if they aren't built upon a solid foundation, we eventually find ourselves having to pay back accrued technical and design debts.

Visual language is like any other language. Misunderstandings arise if the language is not shared and understood by everyone using it. As a product or team grows, the challenges within these modalities compound.

Design has always been largely about systems, and how to create products in a scalable and repeatable way. From Pantone colors to Philips screws, these systems enable us to manage the chaos and create better products. Digital products are perhaps the most fertile ground for implementing these systems and yet it's not often considered a priority.

A unified design system is essential to building better and faster; better because a cohesive experience is more easily understood by our users, and faster because it gives us a common language to work with.

---

Without a design system, you are rendered inflexible. You can't explore and experiment with different layouts. Your layout is somehow fixed, because the components or sub-components depend on the parent container.

> This inflexibility limits exploration; propagating changes is too difficult, tempting us to just stick with the first design that comes to mind. - [Digital product design is not graphic design](https://www.subformapp.com/articles/digital-not-graphic/)

## What's in a Design System

* **Building blocks** - Grid, Color, Typography, Structural, Icons
* **UI Patterns** - Modules, Components, Elements, Templates
* **Rules** - [Design Principles](https://medium.com/@marcintreder/design-system-sprint-4-design-principles-8efb22d8a208), Editorial Guidelines, Behavioral Guidelines
* **Component Variants**
* **Examples**

A design system isn't set in stone. It should evolve with the product and always reflect the truth.

Design tokens are the primitives.

## Broader Strokes - Style Tiles, Element Collages

To establish aesthetic direction, mood and atmosphere.

In design, atmosphere comprises color, typography and texture, **separate from layout**. The layout can drastically change or move around depending on screen size, but the atmosphere (and feeling) remains. Layout is thus inconsequential when compared to the overall atmosphere.

> Atmosphere describes the feelings we get that are evoked by color, texture and typography. The atmosphere of a design **doesn't depend on layout**. It's independent of arrangement and visual placement. It will be seen, or felt, at every screen size and on every device.

Establishing design atmosphere early is critical to a project's success, which is why designers have found ways to facilitate these important conversations without having to generate full mockups. Like style tiles (Samantha Warren) and element collages (Dan Mall).

By breaking **visual explorations** into smaller chunks, designers save time and effort while avoiding presenting unrealistic, premature layouts to client.

## Context-Agnostic and Structural Thinking

* [Architecting a Pattern Library](http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?u=7e093c5cf4&id=ead8a72012&e=ecb25a3f93)

> These blocks can be manufactured in parallel because their underlying structure (typography, spacing, button styles) are already in place! 

See how Structural Engineer evaluate a land for foundation.

The more agnostic pattern names are, the more versatile and reusable they become.

Instead of "homepage carousel", simple called it "carousel". Instead of "product card", simply called it "card". Don't be distracted by the content patterns that live inside them.

> For instance, if working on an e-commerce site, you may be tempted to call a block containing a product image and title a "product card". But naming things in this manner immediately limits what type of content can live inside it. By naming the pattern simply "card", you can put all sorts of content patterns inside it: products, promotions, store locations, and so on.

Naming things is really hard. But by conducting an **Interface Inventory**, you can remove patterns from the context of the page where they normally reside, meaning your team can create names that aren't distracted by their context/content.

Focus on the pattern's structure rather than the content that lives inside it.

Make it agnostic by naming patterns according to their structure rather than their context or content.

You may have a **content model** you identified as Event, with these pieces of information: Title, Date and Location. You probably will mark them up as BEM:

```html
<div class="event">
  <h1 class="event__title">Star Wars</h1>
  <p class="event__date">Dec 20, 2015</div>
  <p class="event__location">Ritz East</div>
</div>
```

But nothing says that Event's content model can't be for Article also. What we need is to extract a Display Pattern out of it. 1 single Display Pattern that can result in many Content Patterns.


## Maintenance

A Design System needs ongoing maintenance, support, and tender loving care for it to truly thrive.

> A style guide is an artefact of design process. A design system is a living, funded product with a roadmap & backlog, serving an ecosystem. - Nathan Curtis

To prevent the system from being eroded by a series of one-off changes, we need to make changes at the system-level rather than at application-level.

Do not anyhow add new patterns to library. Similarly, do not be afraid to create brand new patterns. If every whim results in a brand new pattern, the design system will become a bloated and unwieldy Wild West. It's worth asking if this is a one-off situation or something that can be leveraged in other applications.

> It often falls to the developer to see through the pixels of a comped element to find the actual design pattern. This is why development is design.

---

> I'm finding that I have the most success when my Display patterns don't describe the content within and when my Content patterns don't suggest anything about their presentation.

## Atomic Design

* [Atomic design: how to design systems of components](https://uxdesign.cc/atomic-design-how-to-design-systems-of-components-ab41f24f260e)
* [Atomic Design and Creativity](https://uxdesign.cc/atomic-design-creativity-28ef74d71bc6)

> The part shapes the whole and the whole shapes the part

In the past, we build screen, then deconstruct it into component.

Today, the idea of Atomic Design is to begin with common raw material (atoms) with which we can build the rest of it.

1. Start with a unique visual language that is very close to our brand identity.
2. With a strong identity, we can release our first atoms: colors, typographic, forms, shadows, spaces, rhythms, animations principles...Design Atmosphere (mood-board, style tiles, etc.)
3. Again, it is essential to spend time designing this identity and make it unique, before you can tackle your atoms.
4. To get rid this notion of "page", we will focus on features or user flow, not screens. Make components that are not "connected" to anything.
5. We are going to focus on the action which we want our user to do and on the components that are needed to accomplish this action.
6. Be generic as well as specific.
7. Make distinction between the structure of an element and its contents.
8. Make it both be reusable and rich at the same time.
9. Zoom in on the details and zoom out to verify the results in the greater scheme of things. Even as you are designing reusable components in isolation, you need to make it coherent at the macro-level.
10. Page view is still important for user flow and smooth journey.
11. **Harmony** - It's the right organization of the components. It's what is going to make the final result harmonious and well balanced.
12. **Melody** - It's the story we want to tell to our user and the global vision of the flow. Sometimes the flow needs to be quick and sometimes it needs to be calm.
13. **Rhythm** - Last but not least, the rhythm is what will give user some emotions while using the product: animations, illustration, tone of voice...

```
Brand Identity -> Components -> System as a whole
```
