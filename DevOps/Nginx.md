## Compression

* Typically you don't do gzip compression at Node/Rails server

## Monitoring

* [Nginx Amplify](https://amplify.nginx.com/signup/)

## HTTP/2

To solve latency issues, HTTP/2 uses multiplexing. This does not mean you don't do concatenation anymore. In fact you still need to do it. Just split it up intelligently.

## TCP Slow Start

* Linux Kernels > 2.6.39 enable IW10 by default. See [Make TCP faster](https://googlecode.blogspot.sg/2012/01/lets-make-tcp-faster.html)
* IW10 (14kb initial size)
* Stream large responses to the browser: `Transfer-Encoding: Chunked`

## TLSv1.0 and v1.1

Support for TLSv1.2 was added in OpenSSL 1.0.1 on March 2012.

## Let's Encrypt

```
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name jobline.com.sg www.jobline.com.sg;
  
  location / {
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
  }
}
```

Let's Encrypt performs domain validation by requesting a well-known URL from a domain. If it receives a certain response (the "challenge"), the domain is considered valid.
