# Machine Learning

Machine learning is turning things(data) into numbers and finding patterns in those numbers.

Turning values into number is important. A machine learning model requires all values to be numerical:

- OneHotEncoding
- LabelEncoder
- Embedding encoding

ML is not AI. ML is the ability for an algorithm to learn from prior data in order to produce a behavior. ML is teaching machines to make decisions in situations they have never seen.

Building reliable, robust software is hard. It is even harder when we move from deterministic domains (such as balancing a check book) to uncertain domains (such as recognizing speech or objects in an image). The field of machine learning allows us to **use data** to **build systems** in these uncertain domains, but the field mostly concentrates on accuracy of results.

At certain period of time you do ML on a set of data. After some period, that data is no longer good or valid and if your model still don't change, then you have incorrect learning.

If you use ML to scan for resume to accept or reject but did not learn from the rejected resume, you are not creating a feedback loops where you can learn failure.

Simulated annealing
Knapsack problem
NP-Complete
